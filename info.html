<div id="panel">Mars is a planet of which the entire humanity is curious and most of them
wants to visit it. Our mission also has the journey to the enormous planet
mars, that will be a great event. The mars, second smallest planet in the
solar system, has little heat transfer across its surface, poor insulation
against the bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric
pressure to retain water in a liquid form. The life scope on Mars has kept
everyone in doubt from decades. The journey to Mars from our spacecraft
could be helpful to resolve some questions regarding the atmosphere and
phenomenon over there. Hence, the foremost missions by our company
are planned by taking all the key factors of planets under consideration.</div>

<div id="flip1">Moon</div>
<div id="panel1">Traveling to the moon is challenging along with a sense of a feeling of great
enthusiasm and eagerness. Our mission to the moon has been very
exciting although it takes some days to reach the moon, but we promise to
give you all the way a very great experience. Although, humans had
already visited on the moon, yet our aim is to fulfill your desires to step up
at the dreamful planet ever. This will pave the way for more information,
ideas and scientific facts regarding the moon. You will be able to share to
experience with others so the world can have more knowledge and have
more urge to know the space. No doubt, the journey would not be as easy
but it will be adventurous though. According to our mission, the entire flight
would take about a week, with passengers lifting off aboard the crewed
ship, cruising to the moon, performing a single flyby around the moon and
then returning to Earth. The flight profile has much in common with NASA's
Apollo 8 mission to the moon.</div>
